Open source, in my opinion is the best way to learn coding. I believe that the best way to learn anything is by learning it through real life examples. Open source allows even a beginner like me to experience how the workflow is in the real world. It helps us to know new people and projects and there is always something to learn from others. Thus i want to contribute to open source to learn and to help others. It is an aspect which is too important to be missed.
